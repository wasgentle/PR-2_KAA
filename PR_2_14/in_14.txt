Pressure
Pushing down on me
Pressing down on you.
No man ask for
Under pressure
That burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, "Let me out"
Pray tomorrow gets me higher.
Pressure on people, people on streets
